# KADDU YT-VIEWS SYSTEM üéÉüëÄ

Automated, Smart, and Human-like YouTube View Simulation!

This script helps simulate views for your YouTube videos and shorts using Tor for IP rotation, with a focus on mimicking human-like behavior. **This script is intended for Linux systems only.**

**GitHub:** [https://github.com/Kaddu-Hacker/InfiniteYtViews](https://github.com/Kaddu-Hacker/InfiniteYtViews)

## üöÄ 2025 Update: Smarter Setup & User Experience

- **Automatic Environment Setup:**
  - The script now automatically checks for a Python virtual environment (venv) at startup.
  - If not in a venv, it exits with clear, colorful instructions on how to create and activate one.
  - After venv is detected, it will **automatically install all Python requirements** and **install/start Tor** if needed.
  - All steps show clear, emoji-filled messages for both success and failure, so you always know what is happening and where you might be stuck.
  - If you run as root, the script will warn you and suggest using `sudo -E` to preserve your venv environment variables.
  - Improved venv detection (checks both sys.prefix and VIRTUAL_ENV).

- **Motivational Feedback:**
  - Every step (venv, requirements, Tor install, Tor start) gives a success or failure message with colors and emojis, so you feel motivated and always know what to do next.

- **No More Manual Setup:**
  - Just activate your venv, run the script, and it will handle the rest!


## Features

*   **Smart Human-like Behavior:** Randomized view durations, start delays, and user-agents to appear more organic.
*   **Tor Integration:** Uses Tor for IP rotation, providing anonymity and different IP addresses for views.
*   **Parallel Viewing:** Utilizes multithreading to simulate multiple views concurrently for efficiency.
*   **Link Validation:** Checks if provided YouTube links are accessible via Tor before starting the view process.
*   **User-Friendly CLI:** Interactive command-line interface with colors, emojis, and helpful prompts for Linux terminals.
*   **Video & Shorts Support:** Can process both regular YouTube videos and YouTube Shorts with appropriate watch time considerations.
*   **Customizable:** Set the number of views, parallel connections, and content details.
*   **Dry Run Mode:** Preview the actions the script will take without actually generating views.
*   **System Setup Assistance:** Helps with installing Python dependencies and attempts to manage the Tor service on Linux.
*   **Virtual Environment Guidance:** Prompts users to use a Python virtual environment for better dependency management.
*   **Updated User Agents:** Now uses a list of 50+ real, up-to-date user agent strings for better realism.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Note on Running as Root

This script includes functionality to install system packages (like Tor via `apt`) and manage system services on Linux. Therefore, it **requires `sudo` privileges** for these operations.

**Always be cautious when running scripts with elevated privileges.** It's generally recommended to:
1.  Understand what the script does (review the code).
2.  Run with `sudo` **only** when necessary for specific tasks like initial setup and execution.
3.  Use a virtual environment for Python packages to avoid conflicts with system Python.
4.  If you must use `sudo`, use `sudo -E python3 main.py` to preserve your venv environment variables.

## Setup and Installation (Linux)

It is **STRONGLY RECOMMENDED** to use a Python virtual environment to avoid conflicts with your system's Python packages and to ensure a clean, isolated environment for this script.

**1. Clone the Repository (if you haven't already):**

```bash
# If you have git installed
git clone https://github.com/Kaddu-Hacker/InfiniteYtViews.git
cd InfiniteYtViews
# Otherwise, download the source code and navigate to its directory
```

**2. Create a Python Virtual Environment:**

Open your terminal in the project directory.

*   **On Linux (bash/zsh/etc.):**
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv .venv
    ```
    This will create a folder named `.venv` in your project directory.

**3. Activate the Virtual Environment:**

*   **On Linux (bash/zsh/etc.):**
    ```bash
    source .venv/bin/activate
    ```
    Your terminal prompt should change to indicate that the virtual environment is active (e.g., `(.venv) your-prompt$`).

**4. Run the Script:**

Once the virtual environment is activated, simply run:

```bash
python3 main.py
```

- The script will automatically install all requirements and Tor, and start Tor, if needed.
- If you need to run as root, use:

```bash
sudo -E python3 main.py
```

**You do NOT need to manually install requirements or Tor anymore!**

## Script Workflow

1. **Initial Checks:** Virtual environment, root status.
2. **System Setup:** Installs Python packages from `requirements.txt`. Checks for Tor and attempts to install/start it using system package managers (like `apt`) or the `pytor.py` helper scripts.
3. **User Input:**  
   * Prompts for content type (videos, shorts, or mixed).  
   * For each type, asks for the number of items and an optional default length.  
   * Prompts for individual URLs and their specific lengths (if no default was set).  
   * Asks for the number of views per link and the number of parallel Tor connections.
4. **Tor Status & Link Validation:** Shows the status of Tor connections and validates all provided links via Tor.
5. **Dry Run Option:** Asks if you want to perform a dry run.
6. **View Generation:** If not a dry run, it starts simulating views using a `ThreadPoolExecutor` for parallel processing.  
   * Each view uses a Tor SOCKS port.  
   * Randomized user agents, start delays, and watch times are applied.  
   * Progress is displayed in the console.
7. **Completion:** Shows a summary of views generated and total time taken.

## Important Considerations

*   **YouTube's Terms of Service:** Automating views may be against YouTube's Terms of Service. Use this script responsibly and at your own risk.
*   **Effectiveness:** The actual impact on view counts can vary and may be temporary, as YouTube has sophisticated detection mechanisms.
*   **Resource Usage:** Running many parallel connections can consume system resources and bandwidth. Tor itself adds overhead.
*   **Tor Network:** Be mindful of the Tor network. This tool is for educational and experimental purposes; avoid overloading the network.
*   **SOCKS Dependencies:** If you encounter errors like "Missing dependencies for SOCKS support," ensure `PySocks` is correctly installed in your **activated virtual environment** (`pip install PySocks requests[socks]`).

## Troubleshooting (Linux)

*   **"Missing dependencies for SOCKS support":**  
   * **USE A VIRTUAL ENVIRONMENT!** This is the most common fix.  
   * Activate your venv.  
   * Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` again.  
   * You can also try `pip install PySocks "requests[socks]"` within the venv.
*   **Tor Connection Issues:**  
   * Ensure Tor is installed and the service is running. Use `sudo service tor status` or `systemctl status tor` to check.  
   * Check your firewall settings to ensure Python and Tor can make outbound connections.  
   * If using multiple Tor ports, ensure your Tor configuration (`torrc`) is set up correctly to provide multiple SOCKS listeners (the script currently primarily uses the default 9050 or a sequence starting from it if multiple connections are specified, but `pytor.py` might have its own logic for multiple instances).
*   **Permission Errors (for Tor setup/start):**  
   * The script must be run with `sudo` (e.g., `sudo -E python3 main.py`) for the initial setup steps that install or start the `tor` service and for IP changing operations.
